#Boris Bikes Challenges

This is a program that emulates all the docking stations, bikes, and infrastructure of a city cycle network. Given we are constantly switching pairs and who's project to work on, this was a work in progress stage (the starting stage) or creating a docking station system for Boris Bikes. It was more of a learning experience with Ruby & testing than a finished product. ðŸš²
